    "## 11. ROC curve + AUC\n",
    "<p>Above, we used <code>svm.predict</code> to predict either <code>0.0</code> or <code>1.0</code> for each image in <code>X_test</code>. Now, we'll use <code>svm.predict_proba</code> to get the probability that <strong>each class</strong> is the true label. For example, <code>predict_proba</code> returns <code>[0.46195176, 0.53804824]</code> for the first image, meaning there is a 46% chance the bee in the image is an Apis (<code>0.0</code>) and a 53% chance the bee in the image is a Bombus (<code>1.0</code>). Note that the two probabilities for each image always sum to 1. </p>\n",
    "<p>Using the default settings, probabilities of 0.5 or above are assigned a class label of <code>1.0</code> and those below are assigned a <code>0.0</code>. However, this threshold can be adjusted. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic\">receiver operating characteristic curve</a> (ROC curve) plots the false positive rate and true positive rate at different thresholds. ROC curves are judged visually by how close they are to the upper lefthand corner. </p>\n",
    "<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic#Area_under_the_curve\">area under the curve</a> (AUC) is also calculated, where 1 means every predicted label was correct. Generally, the worst score for AUC is 0.5, which is the performance of a model that randomly guesses. See the scikit-learn documentation for more resources and examples on <a href=\"http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.roc_curve.html\">ROC curves</a> and <a href=\"http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.auc.html\">AUC</a>.</p>"
